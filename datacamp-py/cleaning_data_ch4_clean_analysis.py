'''The tips dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame called tips. This data contains information about how much a customer tipped, whether the customer was male or female, a smoker or not, etc. 
Look at the output of tips.info() in the IPython Shell. You'll note that two columns that should be categorical - sex and smoker - are instead of type object, which is pandas' way of storing arbitrary strings. Your job is to convert these two columns to type category and note the reduced memory usage.'''

# Convert the sex column to type 'category'
tips.sex = tips.sex.astype('category')

# Convert the smoker column to type 'category'
tips.smoker = tips.smoker.astype('category')

# Print the info of tips
print(tips.info())



'''Working with numeric data
If you expect the data type of a column to be numeric (int or float), but instead it is of type object, this typically means that there is a non numeric value in the column, which also signifies bad data.
You can use the pd.to_numeric() function to convert a column into a numeric data type. If the function raises an error, you can be sure that there is a bad value within the column. You can either use the techniques you learned in Chapter 1 to do some exploratory data analysis and find the bad value, or you can choose to ignore or coerce the value into a missing value, NaN.'''


# Convert 'total_bill' to a numeric dtype
tips['total_bill'] = pd.to_numeric(tips['total_bill'], errors='coerce')

# Convert 'tip' to a numeric dtype
tips['tip'] = pd.to_numeric(tips['tip'], errors='coerce')

# Print the info of tips
print(tips.info())



'''When working with data, it is sometimes necessary to write a regular expression to look for properly entered values. Phone numbers in a dataset is a common field that needs to be checked for validity. Your job in this exercise is to define a regular expression to match US phone numbers that fit the pattern of xxx-xxx-xxxx.
The regular expression module in python is re. When performing pattern matching on data, since the pattern will be used for a match across multiple rows, it's better to compile the pattern first using re.compile(), and then use the compiled pattern to match values.'''

'''Import re.
Compile a pattern that matches a phone number of the format xxx-xxx-xxxx.
Use \d{x} to match x digits. Here you'll need to use it three times: twice to match 3 digits, and once to match 4 digits.
Place the regular expression inside re.compile().
Using the .match() method on prog, check whether the pattern matches the string '123-456-7890'.
Using the same approach, now check whether the pattern matches the string '1123-456-7890'''


# Import the regular expression module
import re

# Compile the pattern: prog
prog = re.compile('\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}')

# See if the pattern matches
result = prog.match('123-456-7890')
print(bool(result))

# See if the pattern matches
result = prog.match('1123-456-7890')
print(bool(result))
