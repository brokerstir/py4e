Zip lists to build a DataFrame
In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 'Total'. list_values contains the full names of each country and the number of gold medals awarded. The values have been taken from Wikipedia.
Your job is to use these lists to construct a list of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has already been imported as pd.
Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2).
'''

'''
Zip the 2 lists list_keys and list_values together into one list of (key, value) tuples. Be sure to convert the zip object into a list, and store the result in zipped.
Inspect the contents of zipped using print(). This has been done for you.
Construct a dictionary using zipped. Store the result as data.
Construct a DataFrame using the dictionary. Store the result as df.
'''

# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys, list_values))

# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)

# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)

# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


'''
Labeling your data
You can use the DataFrame attribute df.columns to view and assign new string labels to columns in a pandas DataFrame.
In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and defined a DataFrame df containing top Billboard hits from the 1980s (from Wikipedia). Each row has the year, artist, song name and the number of weeks at the top. However, this DataFrame has the column labels a, b, c, d. Your job is to use the df.columns attribute to re-assign descriptive column labels.
'''

'''
Create a list of new column labels with 'year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks', and assign it to list_labels. 
Assign your list of labels to df.columns.
'''

# Build a list of labels: list_labels
list_labels = ['year', 'artist', 'song', 'chart weeks']

# Assign the list of labels to the columns attribute: df.columns
df.columns = list_labels
